abstract: "Background: The aim of the present study was to investigate
  within-person life satisfaction (LS) dynamics for two age groups, 20–29 and
  30–39 years, from 1984 to 1986 and to follow them over a 20-year period.
  Methods: Data from 1984 to 2008 were extracted from the large, prospective,
  longitudinal North-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT), Norway. This paper includes
  data from more than 14,500 persons. Data were analysed using logistic
  regression, and LS dynamics were modelled using gender, time and self-rated
  health. Results: The analyses revealed that about 20% of people in these age
  groups had a stable level in LS, also known as set point. Long-term LS change,
  defined as ⩾2 SDs, was reported for 9% and 6% of people in the youngest and
  oldest age groups, respectively. A large proportion of more than 70% of people
  had fluctuations in their LS over a 20-year period. A significant decrease in
  within-person LS was seen for the age groups from 1984–86 to 1995–97 where a
  significant increase appeared from 1995–97 to 2006–08. For the initial 20–29
  age group, the odds of having a higher score increased by 34%, and for the
  initial 30–39 age group, the within-person LS increase was 81%. Self-rated
  health was the most crucial variable influencing within-person LS.
  Conclusions: These findings suggest that a significant proportion of the
  responders had a long-term within-person LS change over the 20-year period."
