Now that we have our methods and results we are ready to write a shitty first draft.

And boy is it shitty. The most important thing is that all co-authors agree on the content and acknowledge that this is their last oppurtunity to give input on what the contant of the article should be.

Fill in the following:

What is the area of study and why is it important? Youth anxiety is one of the most costly mental illness and many are not improved by treatment.

What dont we know (enough about)? We dont know enough about how family involvement influences treatment

Why should we care about knowing this? Family involvement may increase treatment

What was the aim of the current study? To investigate if family involvement increased effect of treatment

What was the design and procedure and who participated? 200 youths participated in treatment during 2000-2018 and were assessed at pre and post treatent

What did you find? Youths reduced on self-rated anxiety, but not on parent rated anxiety

What are the implications? Family involvement is effective for treating youth with anxiety.

Send to all co-authors and make sure they completely agree on everything. If they are wondering about moderators or think that a more important angle is appropriate this is the time to say so.

Go through roughly 40 recent abstracs and the ais and scope of the journal and give a score of 0-100% on how well the journal coincides with your population (children vs adults vs anyone), your problem area ( anxiety vs depression vs general mental illness) and your intervention (parental involvement, medication etc.).
